OVERVIEW
Suppose we take an expression in x and y, built by nesting simple primitives: product, average, sin(pi*), and cos(pi*). These four operations map arguments in the range -1 to 1 to results in this same range. Thus, at any point with -1 <= x,y <= 1, our expression built from these primitives will return a value between -1 and 1. By scaling the answer to a grayscale value 0-255, we can plot the function in this 2-by-2 square. (From three such expressions, we can get red, green, and blue values for each point.)

OUR TASK
• Using OO approach and Java to create my own Random Art
• The functions used to produce the random art must be automatically generated by the program
– Minimum of 4 nested levels is required

OUTPUT
• At successful completion, your program should be able to produce
– The random art
– Printout of the functions used to produce the random art

HOW TO START THE PROJECT
You have to start the project by run the RandomArt.class or campile and run RandomArt.java
